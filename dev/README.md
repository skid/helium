# Helium Development
This is the helium development directory. Here's a quick rundown of the structure:

- The "sample-data" directory contains some test data as JS files. Just link these in your page.
- The "lib" directory contains 3rd party libraries. Lodash is a helium requirement.
- The "index.html" is the development playground.
- The "server.js" is the node (connect) development server.
- The "layout.css" contains styles for the index.html page.

The helium javascript and css files are directly loaded from the "src" directory of the project, so no source maps are required.

## Contributing

To contribute to helium, you will need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and the dev dependencies.
