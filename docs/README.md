# Helium Docs

Helium is a UI controls library developed to address the lack of programmable APIs for native HTML controls. The library was developed while working on banking applications where a flexible set of controls let us shift focus from DOM manipulation with jQuery to programming business logic.

Here's some of the stuff that you get from Helium:

- Dedicated Number and Date inputs which accept and return the correct types.
- Lists (replacement for &lt;select&gt; elements) that bind to javascript arrays.
- Custom option renderers for lists.
- Checkbox and radio groups with a list interface.
- SVG icons on inputs and buttons with a simple configuration option.
- Tooltips and error messages.
- Controls that are aware of their labels and apply a css class to them when disabled or marked wrong.
- And much more...

Helium also provides some commonly used controls and widgets like:

- An autocomplete control.
- Modal windows.
- A calendar/datepicker.
- A highly configurable grid control.
